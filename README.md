# **TheraAI**  

#### *"Where Empathy Meets Intelligence"*  

---

## 📝 Overview  
#### Accessible, stigma-free AI counseling assistant that provides warm, human-like support, personalized coping strategies, and consent-based escalation to professional help.  

---

## 🔎 Problem

People don’t just lack counselors—they face stigma, access, and personalization barriers. Many struggle silently until issues escalate to crisis.


---

## 💡 Solution

- TheraAI is voice-friendly assistant that:

- Responds with empathetic, human-like tone (not robotic).

- Suggests personalized coping (breathing, journaling, grounding).

- Safely escalates with user consent to local hotlines/counselors.

- Builds habit & trust via follow-ups, Memory Mirror, and progress celebrations.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Emotional Intelligence (Voice + Tone) – mood-sensitive voice, reflective listening; demo with 2 audio clips.

- Follow-ups & Memory Mirror – recalls past sessions safely and shows growth.

- Progress & Celebrations – milestones, reports, achievement board; shows progress stats and keeps you motivated.

- Smart Escalation – detects risk, offers region-aware hotlines; consent-first handoff.

## 🧭 Impact 

Instant access, earlier help – 24/7, bilingual support; help in <60s; nudges make help-seeking a habit.

Bigger system capacity (AI + human) – triages mild cases so experts focus on crises; shorter queues & faster care.

Population outcomes – anonymous trends inform campus/workplace policy; users leave calmer after sessions.

Equity & reach – voice-first, low-bandwidth, local hotlines → rural/low-income access across SEA & beyond.

---

## 🚀 Novelty 

Transformative access – from waitlists to instant, global 24/7 support.

Empathy-driven AI – tone/voice adaptation that feels human.

Responsible escalation – AI that knows its limits and steps back.

Memory & growth reflection – not a one-off chatbot; supports long-term change.

## 🏗️ Solution Architecture 

![Solution Architecture](./solution.png)  

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js (React), TypeScript, Tailwind

Backend: Node.js (Lambda handlers), API Gateway

AI: Amazon Bedrock (+ Guardrails), optional Comprehend

Data: DynamoDB, S3

Auth/Users: Cognito

Infra: SAM / CloudFormation, CloudWatch, SNS/Pinpoint

---

## 🔐 Safety & Data

Guardrails-first: block unsafe input before LLM calls to reduce risk & cost.

Consent-based escalation: user confirms before hotline/counselor handoff.

Minimal data: session-oriented memory; anonymous metrics for insights.

---

## 💼 Commercialization (B2B)

Who pays: Universities, HR/EAP programs, NGOs/Gov.

What they get: TheraAI access, Admin analytics, Crisis directory, onboarding.

How we charge: Monthly/annual tiers by users + add-ons (counselor dashboard, WhatsApp check-ins, extra languages).

---

## 🌱 Sustainability

Financial: Recurring B2B > serverless infra cost; pilots → annual → multi-campus.

Operational: Serverless AWS, Guardrails, bilingual content, hotline DB upkeep.

Social/Ethical: Privacy-by-design; consent-first; cultural sensitivity (EN/BM).

Environmental: On-demand compute; CDN caching.

---

## 💸 Cost Optimization (Low-Tier Friendly)

Serverless pay-per-use (Lambda, API GW, Cognito).

DynamoDB + S3/CloudFront for low-cost storage & delivery.

Short prompts + cached content to trim Bedrock tokens.

Guardrails-first to avoid expensive/unsafe calls.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

MVP: EN/BM empathy + escalation + progress tracking.

Pilot: 1 campus/SME; measure outcomes (help-seeking, distress reduction).

Scale: Counselor dashboard, more languages/voices, regional hotlines.
